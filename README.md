## Introduction

Learning on data represented with multiple views (e.g.,multiple types of descriptors or modalities) is a rapidlygrowing direction in machine learning and computer vi-sion. Although effectiveness achieved, most existing algo-rithms usually focus on classification or clustering tasks.Differently, in this paper, we focus on unsupervised repre-sentation learning and propose a novel framework termedAutoencoder in Autoencoder Networks (AE2-Nets), whichintegrates information from heterogeneous sources into anintact representation by the nested autoencoder framework.The proposed method has the following merits: (1) ourmodel jointly performs view-specific representation learn-ing (with the inner autoencoder networks) and multi-viewinformation encoding (with the outer autoencoder network-s) in a unified framework; (2) due to the degradation pro-cess from the latent representation to each single view, ourmodel flexibly balances the complementarity and consis-tence among multiple views. The proposed model is effi-ciently solved by the alternating direction method (ADM),and demonstrates the effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.
